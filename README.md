# template_analysis
This is a template for an analysis project.

This directory structure is designed to work with Rstudio for interactive analysis and documentation, while having an execution folder for using on a HPC cluster.

The idea is that all the code and documentation live in GitHub, my laptop and the HPC cluster. 
Most of the data is stored in the cluster, where the bash or nextflow pipelines are ran, and the downstream analysis is done in an Rmarkdown file.
